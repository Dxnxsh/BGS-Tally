# BGS-Tally
A simple plugin for EDMC to count BGS work

# Installation
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/tezw21/BGS-Tally/releases/latest) of BGS Tally
 - In EDMC, on the Plugins settings tab press the “Open” button. This reveals the plugins folder where this app looks for plugins.
 - Open the .zip archive that you downloaded and move the folder contained inside into the plugins folder.

You will need to re-start EDMC for it to notice the new plugin.

# Usage
Enter the Faction name that you want to monitor in the *BGS Tally* tab in *Settings*. The name is not case sensitive. Once set the Faction is persistent until changed by the user

Only four positive actions are counted at the moment. Mission inf + , Total trade profit sold to Faction controlled station, Cartographic data sold to Faction controlled station, Bounties issued by named Faction. These total during the session and reset on restart of EDMC

The data is not currently stored anywhere, including localy. If you need to total across sessions or keep a log of work done this needs to be done manually.
